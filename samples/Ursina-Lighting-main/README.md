# Ursina Lighting
Realistic lighting in ursina!

**I highly recommend using panda3d's built-in lighting (https://docs.panda3d.org/1.10/python/programming/shaders/shader-generator), which is more performant, uses better methods to work and still has the same amount of features as ursina lighting. The only thing missing is the water.**

If you want to have realistic lighting in ursina, import the **UrsinaLighting.py** in your project and use the **LitObject** class instead of the **Enity** class.
If you need help, ask me (https://discord.gg/ydXfhyb) or look in **UrsinaLighting.py** where you can find the source code and an example.
